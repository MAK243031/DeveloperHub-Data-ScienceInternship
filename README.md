# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset and builds a machine learning model to predict passenger survival.

## Project Overview

The sinking of the Titanic is a historical event that has captured the imagination of people for over a century. This project aims to analyze the Titanic dataset, explore patterns and trends, and build a machine-learning model to predict passenger survival.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including their demographics, ticket details, and survival status. It is publicly available and can be downloaded from [link to dataset source].

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** The data is cleaned to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** EDA is performed to gain insights into the data and identify potential factors influencing survival.

3. **Machine Learning Model:** A Logistic Regression model is trained to predict passenger survival.

4. **Model Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of around 80%, indicating good predictive capability. The findings suggest that factors such as gender, class, age, and fare played significant roles in determining survival outcomes.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository URL]`

2. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Run the Jupyter notebook: `jupyter notebook Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb`
